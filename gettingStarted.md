# Getting Started with Python

## Setup
1. Make sure you have python installed. I suggest you use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
2. Install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

## Hello World

Let's get going with a very simple "hello world" program in python. There's a number of ways of writing this very simple python program, and you should try all of them

    $ ipython

and then

    $ print 'hello world'

when you hit 'enter', python should print out the specified text.

Want to see another way to get python to print out 'hello world'? exit ipython using ctrl + d, and use a text editor to make a file called "hello.py". The file contents should be

```
print 'hello world'
```

Then do 

    $ python hello.py

when you hit 'enter', python should print out the specified text.
