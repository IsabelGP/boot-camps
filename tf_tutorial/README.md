# Tensorflow tutorial / workshop

The workshop will use python 3 and TensorFlow 1.6 and can be installed with anaconda or pip. Alternatively, you can find instructions on how to install TensorFlow [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

The pdf slides for the tutorial part of the Hackathon are in the "presentation" folder.
