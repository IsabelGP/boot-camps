# Integrated Development Environments

Integrated development environments (or IDEs) offer software developers a customizable and integrated 
set of tools for managing software projects, writing code, debugging, and unit testing. IDEs allow 
developers to efficiently manage large and complex software projects, which they would struggle with 
if they were to do it the 'old-fashioned' way - e.g., using text editors and print statements for 
debugging.

Major software development firms have shown (over and over again) that developer efficiency increases 
dramatically using IDEs. When it comes to scientific software development, where you often find yourself 
working on legacy code which is the product of several developers over the years (e.g., generations of 
PhDs and post-docs), the visual debugger provided by an IDE (combined with powerful integrated search 
tools) can save massive amounts of time understanding how previous contributors have organized the code 
and the order in which various bits of the program are executed.

Different languages and platforms have their own IDE tools. For example, OSX developers writing in C++, 
C, iOS, or Objective C tend to use XCode, which is Apple's IDE. Microsoft developers writting in C++, C, 
or C# for Windows platforms often use Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE. 

One of the most popular IDEs for Python is called PyCharm. During this session, you will experiment with 
features in the PyCharm community edition (available for download at https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), 
and get a feel for code development and debugging using an IDE.

Using your pyGlet game code, the aim of this session is simply to familiarize yourself with PyCharm, to gain
a better feel of its layout, to understand some of its most commonly used features, and to apply the stepwise 
debugging tools (e.g., breakpoints, line-by-line execution, and stepping into/out of function calls) to your
pyGlet game code.

To facilitate this session, have a look at some of the video tutorials from the PyCharm developers. You are 
likely to find that not all of the features discussed in these videos will be useful to you. To help you better 
focus on those features will I think you are likely to find most useful at this stage, I have provided some 
notes along with each video link below.

1. [Getting started with PyCharmm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPC-bGdBSM8&index=1&list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP) 

    You should watch this video to get a broad feel for the features available in pyCharm. 

2. [Getting Started with PyCharm: Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rSBPGGLkW0&index=2&list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP)

    Note that we will use the PyCharm community version rather than the Professional version. During this software course, all the pyCharm features to which you will need access are included within the community edition

3. [Getting Started with PyCharm: PyCharm UI and Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCJ5kiSmvUY&list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP&index=3)

    This video will give you an overview of the PyCharm UI's structure - most importantly, the text editor, the project window, and guidance on some tricks to navigate both.

4. [Getting Started with PyCharm: Running Python Code] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLfd9LOdu_U&index=4&list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP)

    Note that if you are using Anaconda for [OSX](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (which I recommend!), then you should point PyCharm to the Anaconda install directory for the particular version of python which you are using.
    You should also focus on how to run a Python Console in your project.

5. [Getting Started with PyCharm: Code Navigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmTo5xTRka8&list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP&index=6)

    Here you should focus on file navigation and text/symbol searching functionality. As your code becomes bigger and bigger, these tricks become invaluable.

6. [Getting Started with PyCharm: Debugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJtWxm12Eo0&index=7&list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP)

    Here you should focus on how to read the traceback in the run console and how to run the PyCharm debugger. In particular, you want to focus on how to set breakpoints, how to query the values of variables, how to walk through execution via breakpoints, how to walk through execution using 'step over', 'step into my code', and 'step out of'.
