that you can easily continue to use the same tools for the hackathon!).

You should test your installation using our testing scripts. To access these start a shell and run the 
commands:

    git clone --branch 2016-TMCS-software --single-branch  https://github.com/mikeoconnor0308/boot-camps.git
    cd boot-camps/setup

before following [these instructions](setup/README.md).

You also need to create a free individual account on 
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/). Make sure 
you know your username and password when you arrive

We recommend that you to work through this short tutorial on
