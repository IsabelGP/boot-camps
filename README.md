## Before you arrive...

We recommend that you bring your own laptop to work on (so 
that you can easily continue to use the same tools for the hackathon!).

You should test your installation using our testing scripts. To access these start a shell and run the 
commands:

    git clone --branch 2015-05-oxford --single-branch  https://github.com/mikeoconnor0308/boot-camps.git
    cd boot-camps/setup

before following [these instructions](setup/README.md).

You also need to create a free individual account on 
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/). Make sure 
you know your username and password when you arrive

We recommend that you to work through this short tutorial on 
[Beginning Python](http://chryswoods.com/beginning_python) to refresh yourself on Python.
