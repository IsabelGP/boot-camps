Integrated development environments (or IDEs) offer software developers a customizable and integrated 
set of tools for managing software projects, writing code, debugging, and unit testing. IDEs allow 
developers to efficiently manage large and complex software projects, which they would struggle with 
if they were to do it the 'old-fashioned' way - e.g., using text editors and print statements for debugging.

Major software development firms have shown (over and over again) that developer efficiency increases 
dramatically using IDEs. When it comes to scientific software development, where you often find yourself 
working on legacy code which is the product of several developers over the years (e.g., generations of 
PhDs and post-docs), the visual debugger provided by an IDE (combined with powerful integrated search 
tools) can save massive amounts of time understanding how previous contributors have organized the code 
and the order in which various bits of the program are executed.

Different languages and platforms have their own IDE tools. For example, OSX developers writing in C++, 
C, iOS, or Objective C tend to use XCode, which is Apple's IDE. Microsoft developers writting in C++, C, 
or C# for Windows platforms often use Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE. 

One of the most popular IDEs for Python is called PyCharm. During this session, you will experiment with 
features in the PyCharm community edition (available for download at https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), 
and get a feel for code development and debugging using an IDE.

The aim of this session is to get your morse.py script working in PyCharm, familiarize yourself with 
PyCharm's layout, understand some of its most commonly used features, and apply the stepwise debugging 
tools (e.g., breakpoints, line-by-line execution, and stepping into/out of function calls) to your morse.py 
example.

To facilitate this session, have a look at some of the video tutorials from the PyCharm developers. 
In particular, you should look at:

note that we will use the PyCharm community version rather than the Professional version
